# NFL-Injury-Prediction

This repository contains the final project for UCB MIDS DATASCI 207.

# Problem Statement:
The NFL has always been a very violent sport and injuries are an unfortunate byproduct of this. However, aside from injuries suffered due to the physicality of the game there are also a large number of non-contact injuries that are suffered every year. There has been a suspicion that turf type can have an impact on player injuries but there are a variety of factors on every play that could play a role such as the speed and direction of the player, weather conditions, stadium, etc. 

# Objective:
Build a classification model that can help predict injuries to NFL players based on a suite of factors present during a typical NFL game

# Data
The data and premise of this project was obtained from a Kaggle competition. Both the premise and input data files can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-playing-surface-analytics
